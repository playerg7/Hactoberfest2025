CHANGES IN header.php
Improved documentation — added clear, structured comments explaining each major section of the header file.
Added a Dark Mode toggle button in the top-right corner of the header for better user experience.
Included CSS styles for dark mode (background, text, and link colors).
Added a small JavaScript snippet to switch between light and dark modes dynamically.
Made sure no existing theme functionality was removed or broken — only enhanced visually and in readability.
